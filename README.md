I'm in the middle of a bunfight with my ISP.  I'm experiencing latency of 8 seconds every so often.  You can't make a Skype call when you go AWOL for 8-10 seconds.   So I write a script to start seeing how much latency there is.  This will complain if you go over 1 second for a ping to the first hop in your traceroute.
